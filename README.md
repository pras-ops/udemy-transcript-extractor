- **Improved Performance** - 70% smaller package size (~15MB vs ~85MB)
- **Faster Startup** - Extension loads instantly
- **Better Reliability** - Fewer dependencies means fewer potential issues

### **🧹 Clean Architecture**
- **Simplified Codebase** - Removed ~2000+ lines of AI-related code
- **Better Maintainability** - Easier to add new features and fix bugs
- **Improved Documentation** - Clearer, more focused documentation
- **Modern Stack** - Latest React 19, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS

### **🔒 Privacy-First**
- **Local Processing** - All data stays on your device
- **No External APIs** - No data sent to third-party services
- **No Tracking** - No telemetry or usage analytics
- **Secure** - Following Chrome extension best practices

### **📦 What Was Removed**
- AI summarization features (WebLLM, Transformers.js)
- Model files and WASM binaries
- AI-related dependencies
- Complex performance detection
- Heavy processing libraries

### **💡 Why Remove AI?**
We realized that trying to do both transcript extraction and AI summarization in one extension made it:
- Too large (~85MB)
- Too complex to maintain
- Slower to load
- More prone to errors

By focusing on transcript extraction only, we deliver:
- A lean, fast extension
- Better reliability
- Easier maintenance
- Faster updates

**For AI-powered summarization**, we recommend:
1. Extract transcript with this extension
2. Use your favorite AI tool (ChatGPT, Claude, NotebookLLM, etc.)
3. Get better results with more powerful, up-to-date AI models
