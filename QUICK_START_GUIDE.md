# 🚀 Quick Start Guide - AI Chat Feature

## ⚡ TL;DR

Your extension now has **local AI chat**! Users can talk to their transcripts using a 3B parameter Llama model running in their browser.

---

## 🎯 How It Works

1. User extracts transcript (as usual)
2. Clicks **"Chat with AI"** button
3. Waits for model to load (3-5 min first time)
4. Starts chatting with the transcript!
