1. Go to any Udemy, Coursera, or YouTube video
2. Click the extension icon in your browser toolbar
3. Click "Extract Transcript" (smart button)
4. Choose your preferred format:
   - **TXT** - Clean text for general use

   - **JSON** - Structured data for developers
   - **RAG** - Optimized format for AI tools
5. Transcript is automatically copied to your clipboard
6. Or download as a file

#### Sequential Extraction (Smart Button)
1. After extracting a transcript, the button changes to "Next Lecture & Extract"
2. Click the button to automatically navigate to the next video
3. The extension will:
   - Navigate to the next lecture
   - Extract the transcript automatically
   - Show progress and success indicators
4. Continue this process for multiple videos in a course
5. Export all collected transcripts at once

### Export Formats Explained
