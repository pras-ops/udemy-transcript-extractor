## 🔧 Advanced: Switch Models Manually

If you want to try the 3B model again later (when you have more memory):

Edit `src/offscreen/offscreen.ts`:
```typescript
// Line ~44
this.engine = await webllm.CreateMLCEngine(
  "Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct-q4f32_1-MLC",  // ← Current (small)
  // "Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct-q4f32_1-MLC",  // ← Larger/better
  { initProgressCallback }
);
```

Then rebuild: `npm run build:extension`
