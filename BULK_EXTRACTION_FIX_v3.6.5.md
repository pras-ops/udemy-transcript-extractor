# 🔧 Bulk Extraction Crash Fix - Version 3.6.5

## 🎯 **Problem Identified**

The extension was closing after extracting 2-3 transcripts during bulk operations. This was caused by:

1. **Memory accumulation** from AI model processing
2. **Aggressive memory limits** causing premature cleanup
3. **Rapid processing cycles** without proper delays
4. **Offscreen document instability** during bulk operations

## ✅ **Fixes Applied**

### **1. Memory Management Optimization**

#### **Background Script (`public/background.js`)**
- **Reduced `MAX_PROCESSING_COUNT`**: `15` → `5` operations before cleanup
- **Reduced `MEMORY_CLEANUP_INTERVAL`**: `60s` → `30s` for more frequent cleanup
- **Optimized queue management**: Keep only last 3 requests (was 5)

#### **Offscreen Document (`src/offscreen.ts`)**
- **Reduced memory limit**: `500MB` → `300MB` for better stability
- **Reduced `MAX_PROCESSING_COUNT`**: `10` → `3` operations before cleanup
- **Added cleanup delays**: 1-2 second delays to prevent rapid cycles
- **Improved memory monitoring**: Better detection of high memory usage

### **2. Content Script Optimization**

#### **Batch Processing (`src/lib/content-script.ts`)**
- **Increased delay between operations**: `1s` → `2s` to prevent memory buildup
- **Reduced transcript truncation limit**: `50KB` → `30KB` for better memory management
- **Added memory optimization logging** for better debugging

### **3. Error Handling Improvements**

- **Added delays after cleanup** to prevent rapid cleanup cycles
- **Better error recovery** in memory management functions
- **Improved logging** for debugging memory issues

## 🚀 **Expected Results**

### **Before Fix (v3.6.4)**
- ❌ Extension closes after 2-3 transcript extractions
- ❌ Memory accumulation causes crashes
- ❌ No recovery mechanism

### **After Fix (v3.6.5)**
- ✅ Extension handles 10+ transcript extractions without closing
- ✅ Proactive memory management prevents crashes
- ✅ Automatic cleanup and recovery
- ✅ Better stability during bulk operations

## 📊 **Performance Improvements**

### **Memory Management**
- **Cleanup frequency**: Every 3 operations (was 10-15)
- **Memory limit**: 300MB (was 500MB)
- **Cleanup delays**: 1-2 seconds to prevent rapid cycles

### **Batch Processing**
- **Operation delays**: 2 seconds between extractions
- **Transcript limits**: 30KB max per transcript
- **Queue management**: Keep only 3 recent requests

## 🔧 **Technical Details**

### **Memory Cleanup Process**
1. **Trigger**: Every 3 operations OR 30 seconds
2. **Actions**:
   - Dispose AI pipelines
   - Close stale offscreen documents
   - Force garbage collection
   - Clear request queues
3. **Delays**: 1-2 seconds to prevent rapid cycles

### **Batch Processing Flow**
1. **Extract transcript** from current lecture
2. **Wait 2 seconds** for memory management
3. **Truncate if > 30KB** to prevent memory issues
4. **Store in batch state** with progress tracking
5. **Navigate to next lecture** and repeat

## 📦 **Deployment Package**

**File**: `transcript-extractor-extension-v3.6.5-bulk-fix.zip`  
**Size**: ~3.8MB  
**Status**: Ready for testing

### **Testing Instructions**
1. **Load the extension** in Chrome
2. **Navigate to a Udemy course** with multiple lectures
3. **Start bulk extraction** using "Next" mode
4. **Verify** the extension doesn't close after 2-3 extractions
5. **Test with 10+ lectures** to confirm stability

## 🎉 **Ready for Use**

This version should resolve the bulk extraction crash issue and provide stable performance for extracting multiple transcripts in sequence.
